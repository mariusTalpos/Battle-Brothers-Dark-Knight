You have cast aside the frail light of faith, forging your will in the crucible of despair.\n\nNow, as the final dusk approaches, you stand ready to claim vengeance upon those who let the world decay. The source of the corruption lies ahead, and you will meet it not with prayer, but with steel and fury. Let the world tremble, for a brutal reckoning is at hand.",
